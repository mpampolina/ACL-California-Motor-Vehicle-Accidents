# ACL-California-Motor-Vehicle-Accidents
The following is a *working-in-progress* analysis on motor vehicle accidents recorded in California from March 2016 to December 2019. 

The goal of this study is to have a fun exploratory walk through the dataset, where along the way we may:
* identify the costs and severity of accidents
* discover what contributing factors may impact a traffic accident
* get acquainted to where accidents occur
* discuss what roadway technologies we can implement
* address where these resources can be allocated as to address the most motorist or a sub-category of motorists

Data is available from https://bit.ly/3dO7Kiy and was originally retrieved from the MapQuest, Bing, among other traffic incident APIs. GeoJSON data was accessed from https://bit.ly/2BU6Nbj, with data made possible by the United States Census Bureau. Both datasets were filtered down to capture soley California traffic data and the code associated with the filters are in the accompanying Jupyter Notebooks.
